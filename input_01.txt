I am john.
There is a trash can.
She knows her mother's will.
Can you speak English?
I could go swim.
May I have a seat?
We might have taken a math test.
He will be able to change his name.
I thought she would work on Friday.
Shall we dance.
I should go to swim.
We should have joined at the team.
He must wake up at 9:00 AM.
I must have given my mother a present.
